            I'm currently a Psychology Major at the University of Florida, with a Pre-Law track. I am deeply rooted in my Cuban roots,  which is refelcted in both my cooking and in my dancing! I'm the Vice-President of the Gator Salsa Club on campus doubling as an instructor. Writing is also a passion of mine, with personal dabbles in poetry and prose. I'm also an avid gamer, playing games such as League of Legends at a near professional level. To learn more about my hobbies, click <a href="hobbies.html">here</a>!
